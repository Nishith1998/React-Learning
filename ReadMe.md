# React

**React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.**

Mobile apps and desktop apps feel very **Reactive**: things happen instantly, you don't wait for new pages to load or actions to start.

Traditionally, in web apps, you click a link and wait for a new page to load. You click a button and wait for some action to complete.

> **</>** --request--> Server --html--> **</>**

### </> (Client side JS page)
JavaScript runs in the browser - on the loaded page

You can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) of the page.

We don't need to request a new HTML page using JavaScript itself because we can present(manipulating DOM) something different to user.

React does the same thing.

## What is React.js ?
    A client-side JavaScript library

    All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.

    Declarative, component-focused approach

> HTML, CSS & JavaScript are about building user interfaces as well
  React makes building **complex**, **interactive** and **reactive** user interfaces **simpler**

> React is all about **"Components"**

### Why Components ?
    Reusability - Don't repeat yourself
    Separation of Concerns - Don't do too many things in one and same place(function)
        -->Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions<--

### Declarative Approach
React allows you to create **re-usable and reactive components** consisting of **HTML and JavaScript** (and CSS).

    Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions.

## Create React App
Install Node.js in your system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start
