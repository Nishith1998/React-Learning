# React

**React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.**

Mobile apps and desktop apps feel very **Reactive**: things happen instantly, you don't wait for new pages to load or actions to start.

Traditionally, in web apps, you click a link and wait for a new page to load. You click a button and wait for some action to complete.

    </> --request--> Server --html--> </>

### </>
JavaScript runs in the browser - on the loaded page

You can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) of the page.

We don't need to request a new HTML page using JavaScript itself because we can present(manipulating DOM) something different to user.

React does the same thing.

## What is React.js ?
    A client-side JavaScript library

    All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.

    Declarative, component-focused approach

With JavaScript we can achieve same functionality as React but it would be more complex code for developer to read.
