Making things easy with redux
1. Difficult to manage complex state
2. Action type string typo can happen, have to careful
3. Must not mutate the state - for that also have to very careful in redux

# Starting with Redux-toolkit

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```
We can remove redux (if already have) as reduxjs/ will have the same.

## Creating reducer slices

```jsx
import { createSlice, configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";


const initialState = { counter: 0, showCounter: false };
const counterSlice  = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {state.counter++},
    decrement: (state) => {state.counter--},
    increase: (state, action) => {state.counter += action.amount};
  }
});

// const store = createStore(counterSlice.reducer); // providing reducer to store, but not useful when we have multiple slice. (then we have to combine all slice here)

const store = configureStore({reducer: {counter: counterSlice.reducer}}); // reducer key will take object, which is containing all the reducers slice, key of that object can be any name.
```

> Here it seems like we are mutating the state but under the hood reduxjs-toolkit make sure it is the copy of the state.

> reduxjs-toolkit internally uses `Immer library`` which lets you write code that "mutates" some data, but actually applies the updates immutably.

## actions
The keys of functions declared inside reducers, are actions. Reduxjs-toolkit will create `{type: UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER, payload: IF_ANY_PASSED}` for each reducer functions.

We can export actions like this: 
```jsx
export const counterActions = counterSlice.actions;
```
## dispatch and selector are the same as react-redux
importing actions in components:
```jsx
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { counterActions } from "../store/counter-slice"
import classes from "./Counter.module.css";

const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, show] = useSelector((state) => {
    console.log("state: ", state)
    return [
    state.counter.counter,
    state.counter.showCounter,
  ]}); // subscribing the counter key's value from state
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const toggleCounterHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.toggle());
  };

  const incrementHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.increment());
  };

  const increaseHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.increase(5)); // {type: UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER, payload: 5}
  };

  const decrementHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.decrement());
  };

  return (
    <main className={classes.counter}>
      <h1>Redux Counter</h1>
      {show && 
      <div className={classes.value}>{counter}</div>
      }
      <div>
        <button onClick={incrementHandler}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={increaseHandler}>Increase by 5</button>
        <button onClick={decrementHandler}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
      <button onClick={toggleCounterHandler}>Toggle Counter</button>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Counter;

```
