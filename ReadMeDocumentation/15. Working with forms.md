# What's complex about Forms ?

## Forms and inputs can assume different states.
- One or more inputs are invalid
> Output input-specific error messages and highlight problematic inputs
> Ensure form can't be submitted
- All inputs are valid
> All forms to be submitted

## When to validate ?
- when form is submitted
- when input is losing focus
- on every keystrokes

## Notes:
> Using refs we should not give value to the target element as this will be direct manipulation of DOM (you should leave DOM manipulation to React). Instead we should use state for that.
