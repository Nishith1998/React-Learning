# What's complex about Forms ?

## Forms and inputs can assume different states.
- One or more inputs are invalid
> Output input-specific error messages and highlight problematic inputs
> Ensure form can't be submitted
- All inputs are valid
> All forms to be submitted

## When to validate ?
- when form is submitted
- when input is losing focus
- on every keystrokes
