Working with (Side) Effects - Managing more Complex State with Reducers - Managing App-Wide or Component-Wide State with Context

# What is an "Effect" (or a "Side Effect")?
The component function is re-executed whenever some state changes and then react checks the new results (new JSX code) and compare with previous result, changes should go to real DOM.

| Rendering the view & reacting to user events (and re-render)  | Additional logic not directly related to rendering |
|---|---|
| Main Job: Render UI & React to User Input<br><br>Evaluate & Render JSX<br>Manage State & Props<br>React to (User) Events & Input<br>Re-evaluate Component upon State & Prop Changes<br><br>This all is "backed into" React via the "tools" and features (i.e. useState() Hook, Props etc). | Side Effects: Anything Else<br><br>Store Data in Browser Storage<br> Send Http Requests to Backend Servers<br>Set & Manage Timers<br><br>These tasks **must happen outside of the normal component evaluation** and render cycle - especially since they might block/delay rendering. (e.g. Http requests)|


If we want to send API request from our component and whenever component function re-runs then inside state we will make an api call. Now when response of the api comes again we will change the state to re-render the component function. This can be lead in infinite loop and that's why such side effects should not go directly inside component function.

# useEffect

React hook lets you perform side effects in function components.

![useEffect](../public/images/useEffect.png)

# useEffect Example
We have loginHandler which will implement the logIn functionality (calling the login API on click of login button).

Here just to set an example we will consider the user has loggedIn as soon as the loginHandler runs.

Now After login, we will redirect to home page. (code link)

On refresh the state will not retain and again we will get the login page. To prevent this we will implement localstorage as shown below.

```jsx
// Wrong implementation, causing infinite loop using state
function App() {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  if(localStorage.getItem('isUserLoggedIn')) {
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
  }

  const loginHandler = (email, password) => {
    // We should of course check email and password
    // But it's just a dummy/ demo anyways
    localStorage.setItem('isUserLoggedIn', 1);
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
  };

  const logoutHandler = () => {
    localStorage.setItem('isUserLoggedIn', 1);
    setIsLoggedIn(false);
  };

  return <div></div>
}
```

> This will result in infinite loop as on start of the component function we will check if user has already logged in, if yes then we are using setIsLoggedIn(), that will again execute the component function and same will keep happening...!

In useEffect, we can move the **checking of user logged in** part to the first argument function and in the dependency we don't require to provide anything, as the first argument function should execute only for the first time after component renders (renders for the first time).

```jsx
// Example of useEffect() w/o dependency change
function App() {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if(localStorage.getItem('isUserLoggedIn')) {
      setIsLoggedIn(true);
    }
  }, []);

  const loginHandler = (email, password) => {
    // We should of course check email and password
    // But it's just a dummy/ demo anyways
    localStorage.setItem('isUserLoggedIn', 1);
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
  };

  const logoutHandler = () => {
    localStorage.setItem('isUserLoggedIn', 0);
    setIsLoggedIn(false);
  };    
  
  return <div></div>;
}
```

> We are providing **[] as dependency** and **not making any change** in the same. First **from no value to []**, so first time it will execute the first argument function.

## Example with dependencies:
In the login for if we want valid the form on each key strokes (for every input field), we can use useEffect() as shown below.

```jsx
const Login = (props) => {
  const [enteredEmail, setEnteredEmail] = useState('');
  const [enteredPassword, setEnteredPassword] = useState('');

  useEffect(() =>{
    setFormIsValid(
      enteredEmail.includes('@') && enteredPassword.trim().length > 6
    );
  }, [enteredEmail, enteredPassword]);

  return <div>...</div>
```

> In above example we are not making any HTTP request or localstorage set, still using useEffect (to update the state), because useEffect() is for handling side effects, checking and updating the form validity in response to key strokes is also side effect. (**side effect of a user enter data)

# What should not be added as a dependency

You don't need to add state updating functions (they are never changing (const))

You also don't need to add "built-in" APIs or functions (eg. fetch, localStorage etc)

You also don't need to add variables or functions defined outside of your components.

> you must add all "things" you use in your effect function **if those "things" could change because your component (or some parent component) re-rendered.**
