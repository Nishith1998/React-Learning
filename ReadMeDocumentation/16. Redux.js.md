# What is Redux ?
A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state.

## Three types of states 

1. local state
- State that belongs to a single component.
- Should be managed component internal with useState() / useReducer()

2. Cross-Component state
- State that affects multiple components.
- Eg. open/closed state of modal overlay
- Requires props chains / props drilling

3. App-Wide state
- State that affects the entire app (most/ all components)
- Eg. user authentication status
- Requires props chains/ props drilling

> For 2 & 3 we can use **useContext or Redux** to manage the state

## Redux vs React Context

### React-Context Potential Disadvantages
1. Complex Setup / Management (depends on the application size)
eg. lot of different context provider components.

2. Performance
React context is not optimized for high frequency state changes.

# Core Redux concepts

One Central Data (State) store for whole application.

![Redux concept](../public/images/ReduxConcept.png);

## Exploring core Redux
create an empty node js project.
```bash
npm init -y
```
install redux library
```bash
npm install redux
```
make file `redux-demo.js`
```js
const redux = require('redux'); // importing redux

const counterReducer = (state = {counter: 0}, action) => { // setting the initial value of state 
    return {
        counter: state.counter + 1
    }
};

const store = redux.createStore(counterReducer); // creating a store

const counterSubscriber = () => {
  const latestState = store.getState(); // get latest snap shot after the store is updated
  console.log("latest State: ", latestState);
}

store.subscribe(counterSubscribe); // tell redux who is the subscriber

store.dispatch({type: 'increment'});

```
Output of the code: 
> `{counter: 2}` i.e. first time code executes reducer function will be executed, so that time counter value will be 1, and after that we are dispatching an action that time also reducer function will be executed so counter value is 2.

> We have provide reducer function in createStore so that redux knows which reducer is responsible for changing the store.

> Reducer has the goal of spitting out a new state snapshot when action reaches to it. When we run the code for the first time, through default action reducer will be executed to spit out initial state.

> Reducer function will be called by Redux and it will have two parameters, the existing state and action dispatched. Reducer function has to output a new state.

> Reducer function is pure.

> Redux will execute the subscriber function (counterSubscribe) when there is a change in data in state.

Adding the action type in reducer function see the code [here](../common-codes/ReduxCore/redux-demo.js)

# Working with React
**react-redux** makesconnecting react application to redux stores and reducers very simple
```bash 
npm install redux react-redux
```

We can create the store same as above. But dispatching and subscribing should happen from the react components.

## Providing store to react
For that we need to **provide** our store **to react app** using react-redux.

We should provide the store at the highest level so that all the components in the application can have access.

```jsx
// index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store/index";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```
## Subscribing from component
Now we have `useSelector` hook from react-redux for subscribing to state (part of a state)

> useSelector takes function as argument that provides current state and the passed function returns the part of state we want to subscribe from the store.
```jsx
// counter.js
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import classes from './Counter.module.css';

const Counter = () => {
  const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter); // subscribing the counter key's value from state
  const toggleCounterHandler = () => {};

  return (
    <main className={classes.counter}>
      <h1>Redux Counter</h1>
      <div className={classes.value}>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={toggleCounterHandler}>Toggle Counter</button>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Counter;

```
> When counter key of state is changing, above component will be re-executed.
> When component unmounts, react-redux will clear the subscription.

## Dispatching from component
We have `useDispatch` hook from react-redux for dispatching actions.

> useDispatch returns a function, which can be used to dispatch actions to store.
