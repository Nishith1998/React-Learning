# What is Redux ?
A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state.

## Three types of states 

1. local state
- State that belongs to a single component.
- Should be managed component internal with useState() / useReducer()

2. Cross-Component state
- State that affects multiple components.
- Eg. open/closed state of modal overlay
- Requires props chains / props drilling

3. App-Wide state
- State that affects the entire app (most/ all components)
- Eg. user authentication status
- Requires props chains/ props drilling

> For 2 & 3 we can use **useContext or Redux** to manage the state

## Redux vs React Context

### React-Context Potential Disadvantages
1. Complex Setup / Management (depends on the application size)
eg. lot of different context provider components.

2. Performance
React context is not optimized for high frequency state changes.

One Central Data (State) store for whole application.
