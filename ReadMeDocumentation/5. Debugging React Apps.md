# Understanding Error Messages
If we try to return more than one root elements.(side by side element)

eg. ```return <h1>h1 tag</h1><div>div tag</div>```;

```error
Parsing error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want to JSX fragment <>...</>?
```

Simple typo mistake
```error
*typoMistakeName* is not defined
```

Two Children with the same key
A warning from browser will come when incorrectly key is same for the map elements.

# Breakpoints
We can use breakpoints to fix the errors by analyzing the runtime flow.

From Source in inspect we can find our source code and add breakpoints at any line.

# React DevTools

Dedicated tool available for React development which can help us with React specific problems and can help us with understanding React Application better.

[Add Extension to chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi/related)

On installing React devTools we will get two things added in inspector **profiler** & **components**

Components will show the component tree (only React components).

By clicking we can see component details such as props, rendered by (parent components), source (fileName with line no where the component code is written), hooks (eg. State)
