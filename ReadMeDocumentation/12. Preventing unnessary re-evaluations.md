# Preventing Unnecessary Re-evaluation with React.memo()

> In React, whenever state is changed in one component, the component function will be executed, Since component function return JSX code, all the children components will also be executed.

For larger application we can prevent re-executing of functions (it will only be executed when props are changing) using React.memo

In the below code snippet DemoOutput component function will be re-executed if state is changing in App function component. But DemoOutput is depending upon the props and it is give false - static value.

```jsx
// App.js

function App() => {
    const [showParagraph, setShowParagraph] = useState(false);

    console.log("App RUNNING");

    const toggleParagraphHandler = () => {
        setShowParagraph((prevShowParagraph) => !prevShowParagraph);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1> Hi there ! </h1>
            <DemoOutput show={false}/>
            <Button onClick={toggleParagraphHandler}>Toggle Paragraph !</Button>
        </div>
    )
}

```

To prevent the re-execution of DemoOutput we need to wrap the DemoOutput component function inside React.memo() as shown below:

```jsx
// Example of React.memo()

const DemoOutput = (props) => {
    return <p>{props.show ? 'This is new!' : ''}</p>
}

export default React.memo(DemoOutput);
```

> React.memo() will store the component's props value, and every time there is going to re-execution, it will compare with the previous stored values and if there is no difference component function will not be executed.

> For small app it is okay not to use React.memo(), for larger app also we should be careful in the use as props values stored for the component that is also another performance issue.

## Careful with the non primitive types while using Memo

In above example if we use React.memo() for Button component.

```jsx
// Careful for objects when using React.memo()

const Button = (props) => {
    return (
        <button onClick={props.toggleParagraphHandler}>{props.children}</button>
    )
}

export default React.memo(Button);
```

> Here in props we are passing **function reference**, Now when parent component renders the reference value will be changed. The Button component will execute every time the parent is executing.

## Solution: useCallBack()

It will store the reference and will always reuse the same object when the parent component re-executes.

useCallback() takes two arguments, first is the function that we want to store and seconde is array of dependencies. (similar to useEffect)

```jsx
// Solution for objects when using React.memo()

import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function App() => {
    const [showParagraph, setShowParagraph] = useState(false);

    console.log("App RUNNING");

    const toggleParagraphHandler = useCallback(() => {
        setShowParagraph((prevShowParagraph) => !prevShowParagraph);
    }, [])

    return (
        <div>
            <h1> Hi there ! </h1>
            <DemoOutput show={false}/>
            <Button onClick={toggleParagraphHandler}>Toggle Paragraph !</Button>
        </div>
    )
}

```

### Why dependency is required in useCallback()

When we use useCallback() to store the function reference. It will store all the variables at the time of definition (**Clauser**), now again when same function is executed it will take the stored(old) value and not the updated value from the component function.

That's why we need to provide dependency, so when declared dependency is changing, the function will have the updated value.

#### Example

In below example toggleParagraphHandler is checking if toggling is allowed then only it will set the showParagraph state.

If we are not using the dependency in useCallback (*[allowToggle]*) then the toggleParagraphHandler function will take always the value of allowToggle as **false** (initial value).

```jsx
// why dependency is required for useCallback ?

import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function App() => {
    const [showParagraph, setShowParagraph] = useState(false);
    const [allowToggle, setAllowToggle] = useState(false);

    console.log("App RUNNING");

    const toggleParagraphHandler = useCallback(() => {
        if(allowToggle)
        setShowParagraph((prevShowParagraph) => !prevShowParagraph);
    }, [allowToggle])

    const allowToggleHandler = () => {
        setAllowToggleHandler(true);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1> Hi there ! </h1>
            <DemoOutput show={false}/>
            <Button onClick={allowToggleHandler}>Allow Toggle</Button>
            <Button onClick={toggleParagraphHandler}>Toggle Paragraph !</Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```
