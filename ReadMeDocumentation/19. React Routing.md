```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
## importing createBrowserRouter

import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

createBrowserRouter() --> pass route definitions in form of array of objects

we need to give path and element (component that should be loaded when path url is visited)

> path is part after the domain in url (eg. http://example.com/`path`)

## Providing router to App

To provide router, we need to use `ProvideRouter` by react-router-dom.

```jsx
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Home } from './pages/Home';
import { Products } from './pages/Products';

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/', element: <Home />
  },
  {
    path: '/products', element: <Products />
  }
])

function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router}></RouterProvider>
  );
}
export default App;

```

## Another way of defining routes (old way using components and jsx code)

```jsx
import { Route, createRoutesFromElements, createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const routeDefinitions = createRoutesFromElements(  
  <Route>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/products" element={<Products />} />
  </Route>
)
const router = createBrowserRouter(routeDefinitions);

function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router}></RouterProvider>
  );
}
export default App;
```

## Navigating to pages
The below method works but the page will refreshed.
```jsx
<a href="/products">go to Products page</a>
```

We have Link component in react-router-dom that will act as anchor tag but prevent the page from refreshing.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/products">go to Products page</Link>
```

## Layouts and Nested Routes

For nested routes we can define routes using `children`.

```jsx
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Root />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Home />,
      },
      {
        path: "/products",
        element: <Products />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```
To render this route from parent component, parent component should have `<Outlet />` component, to where the children routes will be replaced.

```jsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { MainNavigation } from "../components/MainNavigation";

export const Root = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MainNavigation />
      <Outlet />
    </>
  );
};

```

## Showing error when page not found
We need to provide `errorElement` key, that will be taken when any error will occur in the mentioned path. (if any error occurs in child it will bubble up to parent)

```jsx
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/", // this is absolute path
    element: <Root />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
    children: [ // give relative paths (if path starts with '/' that is absolute)
      {
        path: "",
        element: <Home />,
      },
      {
        path: "products",
        element: <Products />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

## A way to know which link is active

Instead of using `Link`, if we use `NavLink` in className property we can write a function and that function will get isActive (from destructuring object) key, and we can use that for knowing if path is active (same as current route) or not.
```jsx
import { Link, NavLink } from "react-router-dom";
import classes from "./MainNavigation.module.css";

export const MainNavigation = () => {
  return (
    <header className={classes.header}>
      <nav>
        <ul className={classes.list}>
          <li>
            <NavLink
              to="/"
              className={({ isActive }) =>
                isActive ? classes.active : undefined
              }
              end // this property is match the path provide in to from right, since every path will start through "/", isActive will be true, so end={true} is used.
            >
              Home
            </NavLink>
          </li>
          <li>
            <NavLink
              to="/products"
              className={({ isActive }) =>
                isActive ? classes.active : undefined
              }
            >
              Products
            </NavLink>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
};

```

## Navigating programmatically

To navigate from the code we can use `useNavigate` hook from react-router-dom.

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

export const Home = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const buttonClickHandler = () => {
    navigate("/products");
  };
  return (
    <>
      <div>This is Home Page</div>
      <button onClick={buttonClickHandler}>Navigate to Products</button>
    </>
  );
};

```

## dynamic routes with path param

We can use `useParam` to get the value of path param and in path we need to provide `:` to make that as dynamic value.

## absolute and relative paths

If we provide `/` in path property it will be considered as absolute path. 

In navigation also if `/` is added in (eg. `navigate('/products')`) paths, then redirected path will replace the current url and add what defined in path (`/products`) after domain name. (eg. `http://localhost:3000/products`)

If we are not adding `/` before the path, it will not replace the current url but will add to current url. So for example current url is `http://localhost:3000/myApp` and if we give `<Link to="products">Products</Link>`, the redirected path will be `http://localhost:3000/myApp/products`.

## relative property in Link
relative property can have two values: `path` & `route`

> 'route' is the default value.

> relative prop does not matter if you are providing `/` (absolute path), then it will be absolute only.

If url is `http://localhost:3000/root/products/product-details` and in router definitions we have given routes like this: 
`path: '/root', children: [{path: 'products/product-details' element: <ProductDetail />}`

<Link to=".." relative="path">back</Link> // this is redirect to http://localhost:3000/root/products

<Link to=".." relative="route">back</Link> // this is redirect to http://localhost:3000/root

## loader()

Fetching API data before component loads (executes).

> we have loader property in route obj, that takes function, which will be executed when route is matched

> The returned data from loader function will be available to component.

```jsx
// App.tsx createBrowserRouter, 
...
      {
        path: "/products",
        element: <Products />,
        loader: async () => {
          let response = await fetch('https://real-time-emp-8518f-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/cart.json');
          let data;
          try {
            if(response.ok) {
              data = await response.json();
            }
          } catch {
            // error
          }
          return data;
        }
      },
...
```

To access the returned data from loader, we have useLoaderData() hook

> useLoaderData() will provide closest loader data
```jsx
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';

export default const App() {
  const loaderData = useLoaderData();
  return (<></>)
}
```
